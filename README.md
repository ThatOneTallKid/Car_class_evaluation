This program predicts the Class to which a Car belongs to based on its features. 
K-Nearest Neighbors works by looking at the K closest points to the given data point (the one we want to classify) and picking the class that occurs the most to be the predicted value.
The Car Evaluation Database contains examples with the structural information removed, i.e., directly relates CAR to the six input attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety. Because of known underlying concept structure, this database may be particularly useful for testing constructive induction and structure discovery methods.
